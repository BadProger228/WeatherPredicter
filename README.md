# Weather Prediction

## Description
**Weather Prediction** is a machine learning-based application that predicts the weather based on historical hourly weather data spanning the last 100 years for a specific region. The application trains a neural network model and saves it for future use. Users can input a date range to generate weather predictions, view results in a list, and display temperature and wind speed graphs. Additionally, the application provides an option to predict the temperature for the next day with a single button click.

## Features
- Train a neural network model using historical weather data.
- Save and load the trained model for future predictions.
- Predict weather for a user-specified date range.
- Display results in a list box with selectable dates.
- Show temperature and wind speed graphs for selected dates.
- Predict the next day's temperature with a dedicated button.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Persistence:** Joblib
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Multithreading Support**


## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn joblib matplotlib
   ```
2. Ensure that the dataset is available in the expected format.
3. Run the script to train the model (if not already trained).
4. Launch the GUI application.
5. Select a date range and view predictions.
